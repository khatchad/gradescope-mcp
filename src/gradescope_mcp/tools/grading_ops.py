        confidence: Agent's self-assessed grading confidence (0.0-1.0).

          ``apply_grade``: ``None`` keeps current rubric state, ``[]`` clears
          all items, a list overwrites with that exact set.
        - ``point_adjustment``: float | None — ``None`` keeps current.
        - ``comment``: str | None — per-submission comment (Gradescope's
          "Provide comments specific to this submission" field, separate
          from rubric items). ``None`` keeps the existing comment, ``""``
          clears it, any other string overwrites.
        - ``confidence``: float | None — per-row gate (<0.6 is rejected).
        - ``full_credit``: bool — when true, marks the row full credit via the
          question's 0-point benchmark item (negative scoring only). Use this
          instead of ``rubric_item_ids: []``, which clears items but leaves the
          submission ungraded. Cannot be combined with ``rubric_item_ids``.

    All entries are applied to the same ``question_id``. Confidence gating is
    per-row. On ``confirm_write=False`` returns a compact preview table.
    On ``confirm_write=True`` returns an execution summary (succeeded /
    failed / skipped-by-confidence) with per-row details.

    This is meant for the main agent's post-approval execution phase. Subagents
    cannot call write-gated tools in the Claude Code harness, so all writes
    must funnel through the main agent; a batch variant cuts round-trips
    dramatically for large grading runs.

    **Do NOT pass negative weight values.** Gradescope expects positive
